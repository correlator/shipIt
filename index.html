      <h2 class='explainer'>What we believe</h2>
      <p>
        There is infinite opportunity for technology to improve people's lives and to increase the revenue flowing to profitable businesses.
        These problems remain unsolved because it is challenging for small and medium businesses to attact and keep quality engineering talent.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p>
        Too many engineers are working to improve vanity metrics in the hopes of owning miniscule fractions of a billion dollar, venture backed business.
        These metrics lead to artificial deadlines, burned out developers, and a dearth of talent left for small and medium businesses that are generating real revenue and real value.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p>
        We aim to unlock value by connecting stable, cash-flow businesses with talented engineers who want to sove real tangible problems.
        The businesses get high quality software delivered on time and engineers are paid reasonable salaries with real equity that pays dividends every quarter.
      </p>

      <h2 class='explainer'>What we do</h2>
      <p>
         We work with businesses that sell products for a profit within a market that they uniquely understand.  There are three capacities that we work with companies:
      </p>
      </br>
      <h4 class='explainer'>
        Create products that add to the top line.
      </h4>
      <p>
        When you service a market, you know exactly what that market needs and is looking for.  There may be a wonderful market opportunity that Silicon Valley is ignoring because
        "10 billion is the new billion."  If people repeatedly ask your sales team how to solve a problem that doesn't yet have a good technical solution, this can be a great opportunity to add to your top line revenue.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h4 class='explainer'>
        Increase efficiency to raise the bottom line.
      </h4>
      <p>
        It is all hands on deck at small and medium businesses and the way each hour is spent matters.  That means repetitive tasks that takes 5 to 10 hours a week not only cost time
        but they also take valuable resources away from work that can drive the business forward.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h4 class='explainer'>
        Provide part time development support.
      </h4>
      <p>
        If your product has a component of technology, you likely don't need a full time development team, and don't want to set aside a huge budget for development. 
        It is hard to find good engineers who will work alone and part time on a small business venture.
      </p>

      <h2 class='explainer'>What we value</h2>
      <p>

            We are all on the same team with the same goal in mind.  Help your team achieve their goals and they will return the favor.
