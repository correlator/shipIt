      <h2 class='explainer'>What we believe</h2>
      <p>
        Too many engineers move through their career working to improve vanity metrics in the hopes of owning 0.05% of a billion dollar, venture backed business.
        These artificial metrics lead to artificial deadlines, burned out developers, and a dearth of talent left for small and medium businesses that are generating real revenue and real value.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p>
        We believe there is infinite opportunity for technology to improve people's lives and to increase the revenue flowing to profitable businesses.  Engineers who work on these problems
        are less stressed, more productive and more excited to get code shipped.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p>
         Finally, engineers should be paid reasonable salaries and  have real equity that pays dividends every quarter as the company generates profits.
      </p>
      <div class='divider'></div>
      <h2 class='explainer'>Who we work with</h2>
      <p>
         We work with businesses that sell products for a profit within a market that they uniquely understand.  There are three capacities that we work with companies:
      </p>
      </br>
      <h4 class='explainer'>
        Add-on products that require custom technology.
      </h4>
      <p>
        When you service a market, you know exactly what that market needs and is looking for.  There may be a wonderful market opportunity that Silicon Valley is ignoring because
        "10 billion is the new billion."  If people repeatedly ask your sales team how to solve a problem that doesn't yet have a good technical solution, this can be a great opportunity to add to your top line revenue.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h4 class='explainer'>
        Increase internal efficiencies and the bottom line.
      </h4>
      <p>
        It is all hands on deck at small and medium businesses and the way each hour is spent matters.  That means repetitive tasks that takes 5 to 10 hours a week not only cost time
        but they also take valuable resources away from work that can drive the business forward.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h4 class='explainer'>
        Outsourced part time development work.
      </h4>
      <p>
        If your product has a component of technology, you likely don't need a full time development team, and don't want to set aside a huge budget for development.  It is really hard to find good engineers who will work alone
        and part time on a small business venture.

      <h2 class='explainer'>Our values</h2>
      <p>
        Guiding principles for questions that don't have easy answers
      </p>
      </br>
      <div class='row'>
        <div class='span six'>
          <h4 class='explainer'>Support your team</h4>
          <p>
          We are all on the same team with the same goal in mind.  Don't let your team down and they won't let you down.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='span six'>
          <h4 class='explainer'>Deliver value</h4>
          <p>
            We are our best selves when we are helping clients and teammates be their best selves.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class='row' style="line-height:1em">
        <div class='span six'>
          <h4 class='explainer'>Have integrity</h4>
          <p>
          We are playing the long game, so communicate good and bad news early and clearly.  A dentist who is afraid to tell clients they have a cavity will not stay in business.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='span six'>
          <h4 class='explainer'>Cut hair</h4>
          <p>
            We don't slave over vanity metrics and shiny objects, we deliver value to our customers.  The best barber has the worst haircut.
